Description: The 'APT Package Management System' provides Debian and
 Debian-derived Linux systems with a powerful system to resolve package
 dependencies. This package offers access directly from R.  This can
 only work on a system with a suitable 'libapt-pkg-dev' installation
 so functionality is curtailed if such a library is not found.
